# localop


## Description

Prevents subsequent commands from being executed on remote peers. Tells the search to run subsequent commands locally, instead.

The localop command forces subsequent commands to be part of the reduce step of the mapreduce process.


## Syntax

localop


## Examples


### Example 1:

The iplocation command in this case will never be run on remote peers. All events from remote peers that originate from the initial search, which was for the terms FOO and BAR, are forwarded to the search head. The search head is where the iplocation command is run.

CODE

Copy

FOO BAR | localop | iplocation clientip


```spl

FOO BAR | localop | iplocation clientip

```
