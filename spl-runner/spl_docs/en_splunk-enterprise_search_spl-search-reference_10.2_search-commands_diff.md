# diff


## Description

The diff command mimics \*nix diff output and compares two search results at a time by returning the line-by-line difference, or comparison, of the two. The two search results compared are specified by the two position values position1 and position2 . These values default to 1 and 2 to compare the first two results.

By default, the text ( _raw field) of the two search results is compared. Other fields can be compared by selecting another field using attribute .


## Syntax

diff [position1= int ] [position2= int ] [attribute= string ] [diffheader= bool ] [context= bool ] [maxlen= int ]


### Optional arguments

position1

Datatype: &lt;int&gt;

Description: Of the table of input search results, selects a specific search result to compare to position2.

Default: position1=1 and refers to the first search result.

position2

Datatype: &lt;int&gt;

Description: Of the table of input search results, selects a specific search result to compare to position1. This value must be greater than position1 .

Default: position2=2 and refers to the second search result.

attribute

Datatype: &lt;field&gt;

Description: The field name to be compared between the two search results.

Default: attribute=_raw , which refers to the text of the event or result.

diffheader

Datatype: &lt;bool&gt;

Description: If true, show the traditional diff header, naming the "files" compared. The diff header makes the output a valid diff as would be expected by the programmer command-line patch command.

Default: diffheader=false .

context

Datatype: &lt;bool&gt;

Description: If true, selects context-mode diff output as opposed to the default unified diff output .

Default: context=false , or unified.

maxlen

Datatype: &lt;int&gt;

Description: Controls the maximum content in bytes diffed from the two events. If maxlen=0 , there is no limit.

Default: maxlen=100000 , which is 100KB.


## Examples


### Example 1:

Compare the "ip" values of the first and third search results.

CODE

Copy

... | diff pos1=1 pos2=3 attribute=ip


```spl

... | diff pos1=1 pos2=3 attribute=ip

```



### Example 2:

Compare the 9th search results to the 10th.

CODE

Copy

... | diff position1=9 position2=10


```spl

... | diff position1=9 position2=10

```
