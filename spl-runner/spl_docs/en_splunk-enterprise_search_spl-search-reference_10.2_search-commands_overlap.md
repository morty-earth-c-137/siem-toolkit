> **Note: You should not use the overlap command to fill or backfill summary indexes. Splunk Enterprise provides a script called fill_summary_index.py that backfills your indexes or fill summary index gaps. If you have Splunk Cloud Platform and need to backfill, open a Support ticket and specify the time range, app, search name, user and any other details required to enable Splunk Support to backfill the required data. For more information, see "Manage summary index gaps" in the Knowledge Manager Manual .**



## Description

Find events in a summary index that overlap in time, or find gaps in time during which a scheduled saved search might have missed events.

- If you find a gap, run the search over the period of the gap and summary index the results using "| collect".

- If you find overlapping events, manually delete the overlaps from the summary index by using the search language.

The overlap command invokes an external python script $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/bin/ sumindexoverlap.py . The script expects input events from the summary index and finds any time overlaps and gaps between events with the same 'info_search_name' but different 'info_search_id'.

Important: Input events are expected to have the following fields: 'info_min_time', 'info_max_time' (inclusive and exclusive, respectively) , 'info_search_id' and 'info_search_name' fields. If the index contains raw events (_raw), the overlap command does not work. Instead, the index should contain events such as chart , stats , and timechart results.
