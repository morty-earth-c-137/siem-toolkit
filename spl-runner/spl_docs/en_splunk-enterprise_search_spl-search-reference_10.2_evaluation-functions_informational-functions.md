# Informational functions

The following list contains the functions that you can use to return information about a value.

For information about using string and numeric fields in functions, and nesting functions, see Evaluation functions .


## isarray(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and evaluates whether the value is an array data type. The function returns TRUE if the value is an array.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Basic examples

The following search returns True because [1, 2, 3] is an array.

CODE

Copy

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isarray("[1, 2, 3]"), "True", "False")


```spl

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isarray("[1, 2, 3]"), "True", "False")

```




The result of the following search is


```spl

False

```


because


```spl

1

```


is not an array.



CODE

Copy

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isarray(1), "True", "False")


```spl

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isarray(1), "True", "False")

```



## isbool(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and evaluates whether the value is a Boolean data type. The function returns TRUE if the value is Boolean.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

Use this function with other functions that return Boolean data types, such as cidrmatch and mvfind .

This function cannot be used to determine if field values are "true" or "false" because field values are either string or number data types. Instead, use syntax such as &lt;fieldname&gt;=true OR &lt;fieldname&gt;=false to determine field values.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Basic examples

The following search returns True because 1==2 is Boolean.

CODE

Copy

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isbool(1==2), "True", "False")


```spl

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isbool(1==2), "True", "False")

```




The following search returns


```spl

False

```


because the value


```spl

a

```


is not Boolean.



CODE

Copy

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isbool(a), "True", "False")


```spl

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isbool(a), "True", "False")

```



## isdouble(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and evaluates whether the value is a double data type. The function returns TRUE if the value is a double value.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Basic examples

The following search returns True because the value 3.546 is a double.

CODE

Copy

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isdouble(3.546), "True", "False")


```spl

| makeresults
| eval result = if(isdouble(3.546), "True", "False")

```




The following example returns


```spl

False

```


because


```spl

1000000

```


is not a double.



CODE

Copy

... | eval result = if(isdouble(1000000), "True", "False")


```spl

... | eval result = if(isdouble(1000000), "True", "False")

```



## isint(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and returns TRUE if the value is an integer.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Basic examples

The following example uses the isint function with the if function. A field, "n", is added to each result with a value of "int" or "not int", depending on the result of the isint function. If the value of "field" is a number, the isint function returns TRUE and the value adds the value "int" to the "n" field.

CODE

Copy

... | eval n=if(isint(field),"int", "not int")


```spl

... | eval n=if(isint(field),"int", "not int")

```




The following example shows how to use the


```spl

isint

```


function with the


```spl

where

```


command.



CODE

Copy

... | where isint(field)


```spl

... | where isint(field)

```



## ismv(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and evaluates whether the field is a multivalue data type. The function returns TRUE if the field is a multivalue.




### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Basic examples

The following example returns True because the value in the number_list field is a multivalue.

CODE

Copy

... | eval number_list=split("1, 2, 3", ",")
| eval result=if(ismv(number_list), "True", "False")


```spl

... | eval number_list=split("1, 2, 3", ",")
| eval result=if(ismv(number_list), "True", "False")

```


The result looks like this:


| _time | number_list | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-12-11 00:49:31 | 123 | True |



## isnotnull(&lt;value&gt;)

This function takes one argument and returns TRUE if the value is not NULL.


### Usage

This function is useful for checking for whether or not a field contains a value.

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Basic examples

The following example uses the isnotnull function with the if function. A field, "n", is added to each result with a value of "yes" or "no", depending on the result of the isnotnull function. If the value of "field" is a number, the isnotnull function returns TRUE and the value adds the value "yes" to the "n" field.

CODE

Copy

## isnum(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and returns TRUE if the value is a number.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.


### Using isnum in searches with NaN

In eval functions, fields can be either a string or a number. Working with NaN (Not a Number) values in the Splunk platform can be challenging because Splunk fields contain values that can be processed as either strings or numeric values based on their context. This can create confusion between a numeric NaN value, and the string representation of that value, "NaN". For example, depending on the kind of value that is needed to satisfy the current calculation, a NaN can be a numeric NaN , or a string "NaN" that can be interpreted as a numeric value or treated as a string. If your data contains "NaN" , you should proceed with caution when using searches that require NaN handling in SPL because NaN values can behave in unexpected ways.

If you're using "NaN" in your searches with the isnum command, it's important to distinguish between a literal string "NaN" and a field containing the value "NaN" . When a field contains a "NaN" string, the "NaN" behaves as both a string and a number. However, when a "NaN" value is present as a literal string in an evaluator expression, it is considered a string, not a number.

For example, because "NaN" is just a collection of characters, it is considered a string and returns false in a search like isnum("NaN") . However, if the same value is stored as "NaN" in a field, it is parsed as a numeric type. For example, say you run the following search.

CODE

Copy

| makeresults 
| eval strval="NaN", numval=strval % 1 
| fields - _time
| eval literalIsNumeric=if(isnum("anystring"), "true", "false")
| eval literalNanIsNumeric=if(isnum("NaN"), "true", "false")
| eval numvalIsNumeric=if(isnum(numval), "true", "false")
| eval strvalIsNumeric=if(isnum(strval), "true", "false")
| transpose


```spl

| makeresults 
| eval strval="NaN", numval=strval % 1 
| fields - _time
| eval literalIsNumeric=if(isnum("anystring"), "true", "false")
| eval literalNanIsNumeric=if(isnum("NaN"), "true", "false")
| eval numvalIsNumeric=if(isnum(numval), "true", "false")
| eval strvalIsNumeric=if(isnum(strval), "true", "false")
| transpose

```


Your results look like this. Notice that literalNanIsNumeric is false because the isnum command interprets "NaN" as a string, not a number.


| column | row |
| --- | --- |
| literalIsNumeric | false |
| literalNanIsNumeric | false |
| numval | NaN |
| numvalIsNumeric | true |
| strval | NaN |
| strvalIsNumeric | true |


It can be difficult to determine whether a value stored in a numeric field is a NaN or a literal value. A reliable test for NaN in the Splunk platform to confirm that a value is a real numeric NaN is to include the following search string in your search:

CODE

Copy

| eval isnan=if(isnum(numval), match(numval,"NaN"), false)


```spl

| eval isnan=if(isnum(numval), match(numval,"NaN"), false)

```


For example, if the value you're testing is "NaN" , the search returns isnan is True , like the following search:

CODE

Copy

| makeresults 
| eval strval="NaN", numval=strval % 1
| eval isnan=if(isnum(numval), match(numval,"NaN"), false)
| transpose


```spl

| makeresults 
| eval strval="NaN", numval=strval % 1
| eval isnan=if(isnum(numval), match(numval,"NaN"), false)
| transpose

```


See Numeric calculations .


### Basic examples

The following example uses the isnum function with the if function. A field, "n", is added to each result with a value of "yes" or "no", depending on the result of the isnum function. If the value of "field" is a number, the isnum function returns TRUE and the value adds the value "yes" to the "n" field.

CODE

Copy

... | eval n=if(isnum(field),"yes","no")


```spl

... | eval n=if(isnum(field),"yes","no")

```




The following example shows how to use the


```spl

isnum

```


function with the


```spl

where

```


command.



CODE

Copy

... | where isnum(field)


```spl

... | where isnum(field)

```



## isobject(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and evaluates whether the value is an object. The function returns TRUE if a string is a valid JSON object.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Basic examples

The following example returns False because the value in the games field isn't a valid JSON object.

CODE

Copy

... | eval games = "Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan"
| eval result = if(isobject("games"), "True", "False")


```spl

... | eval games = "Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan"
| eval result = if(isobject("games"), "True", "False")

```


The following example returns True because the value in the games field is a valid JSON object.

JSON

Copy

... | eval games = "{\"type\": \"competitive\", \"name\": \"Ticket to Ride\"}"
| eval result = if(isobject(games), "True", "False")


```spl

... | eval games = "{\"type\": \"competitive\", \"name\": \"Ticket to Ride\"}"
| eval result = if(isobject(games), "True", "False")

```




Say you run the following search.



JSON

Copy

| makeresults
|eval is_an_object = if(isobject("{cities: \"3\"}"), "is object", "is not object")


```spl

| makeresults
|eval is_an_object = if(isobject("{cities: \"3\"}"), "is object", "is not object")

```


Your results look like this.


| _time | is_an_object |
| --- | --- |
| 2024-12-19 21:49:04 | is not object |



## isstr(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and returns TRUE if the value is a string.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.

You can use this function directly with the where command in searches, but the eval command can't directly accept a Boolean value. You must specify the function inside another function, such as the if function, which can accept a Boolean value as an input.


### Using isstr in searches with NaN

In eval functions, fields can be either a string or a number. Working with NaN (Not a Number) values in the Splunk platform can be challenging because Splunk fields contain values that can be processed as either strings or numeric values based on their context. This can create confusion between a numeric NaN value, and the string representation of that value, "NaN". For example, depending on the kind of value that is needed to satisfy the current calculation, a NaN can be a numeric NaN , or a string "NaN" that can be interpreted as a numeric value or treated as a string. If your data contains "NaN" , you should proceed with caution when using searches that require NaN handling in SPL because NaN values can behave in unexpected ways.

If you're using "NaN" in your searches with the isstr command, the distinction between a literal string "NaN" and a field containing the value "NaN" is not as important as it is with the isnum command. When a "NaN" string is contained in a field, the "NaN" behaves as both a string and a number. But, when a "NaN" value is present as a literal string in an evaluator expression, it is considered a string, not a number. In both cases, the isstr command parses the "NaN" value as a string.

For example, say you run the following search.

CODE

Copy

| makeresults 
| eval strval="NaN", numval=strval % 1 
| fields - _time
| eval literalIsStr=if(isstr("anystring"), "true", "false")
| eval literalNanIsStr=if(isstr("NaN"), "true", "false")
| eval numvalIsStr=if(isstr(numval), "true", "false")
| eval strvalIsStr=if(isstr(strval), "true", "false")
| transpose


```spl

| makeresults 
| eval strval="NaN", numval=strval % 1 
| fields - _time
| eval literalIsStr=if(isstr("anystring"), "true", "false")
| eval literalNanIsStr=if(isstr("NaN"), "true", "false")
| eval numvalIsStr=if(isstr(numval), "true", "false")
| eval strvalIsStr=if(isstr(strval), "true", "false")
| transpose

```


Your results look like this. Notice that, as expected, each isstr test identifies "NaN" as a string, regardless of whether the "NaN" is a string or numeric value.


| column | row |
| --- | --- |
| literalIsStr | true |
| literalNanIsStr | true |
| numval | NaN |
| numvalIsStr | true |
| strval | NaN |
| strvalIsStr | true |


See Numeric calculations .


### Basic examples

The following example uses the isstr function with the if function. A field, "n", is added to each result with a value of "yes" or "no", depending on the result of the isstr function. If the value of "field" is a string, the isstr function returns TRUE and the value adds the value "yes" to the "n" field.

CODE

Copy

... | eval n=if(isstr(field),"yes","no")


```spl

... | eval n=if(isstr(field),"yes","no")

```




The following example shows how to use the


```spl

isstr

```


function with the


```spl

where

```


command.



CODE

Copy

... | where isstr(field)


```spl

... | where isstr(field)

```



## typeof(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

This function takes one argument and returns the data type of the argument.


### Usage

You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions.


### Basic examples

The following example takes one argument and returns a string representation of its type. This example returns "NumberStringBoolInvalid"

CODE

Copy

... | eval n=typeof(12) + typeof("string") + typeof(1==2) + typeof(badfield)


```spl

... | eval n=typeof(12) + typeof("string") + typeof(1==2) + typeof(badfield)

```




The following example creates a single result using the


```spl

makeresults

```


command.



CODE

Copy

| makeresults


```spl

| makeresults

```


For example:


| _time |
| --- |
| 2018-08-14 14:00:15 |


To determine the data type of the _time field, use the eval command with the typeof function. For example:

CODE

Copy

| makeresults | eval t=typeof(_time)


```spl

| makeresults | eval t=typeof(_time)

```


The results are:


| _time | t |
| --- | --- |
| 2018-08-14 14:00:15 | Number |
