# cofilter


## Description

Use this command to determine how many times a value in &lt;field1&gt; and a value in &lt;field2&gt; occur together. For example, if you have a field that contains user IDs and another field that contains items names, this command finds how common each pair of user and item occur.

This command implements one step in a collaborative filtering analysis for making recommendations.


## Syntax

cofilter &lt;field1&gt; &lt;field2&gt;


### Required arguments

field1

Syntax: &lt;field&gt;

Description: The name of field.

field2

Syntax: &lt;field&gt;

Description: The name of a field.




## Usage

The cofilter command is a transforming command. See Command types .


## Examples


### Example 1

Find the cofilter for user and item . The user field must be specified first and followed by the item field. The output is an event for each pair of items with: the first item and its popularity, the second item and its popularity, and the popularity of that pair of items.

Let's start with a simple search to create a few results:

CODE

Copy

| makeresults 
| eval user="a b c a b c a b c"
| makemv user
| mvexpand user
| streamstats count


```spl

| makeresults 
| eval user="a b c a b c a b c"
| makemv user
| mvexpand user
| streamstats count

```


The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this:


| _time | count | user |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 1 | a |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 2 | b |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 3 | c |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 4 | a |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 5 | b |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 6 | c |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 7 | a |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 8 | b |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 9 | c |


The eval command with the modulus ( % ) operator is used to create the item field:

CODE

Copy

| makeresults 
| eval user="a b c a b c a b c"
| makemv user
| mvexpand user
| streamstats count
| eval item = count % 5


```spl

| makeresults 
| eval user="a b c a b c a b c"
| makemv user
| mvexpand user
| streamstats count
| eval item = count % 5

```


The results look like this:


| _time | count | item | user |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 1 | 1 | a |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 2 | 2 | b |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 3 | 3 | c |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 4 | 4 | a |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 5 | 0 | b |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 6 | 1 | c |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 7 | 2 | a |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 8 | 3 | b |
| 2020-02-19 21:17:54 | 9 | 4 | c |


Add the cofilter command to the search to determine how many user values occurred with each item value,

CODE

Copy

| makeresults 
| eval user="a b c a b c a b c"
| makemv user
| mvexpand user
| streamstats count
| eval item = count % 5
| cofilter user item


```spl

| makeresults 
| eval user="a b c a b c a b c"
| makemv user
| mvexpand user
| streamstats count
| eval item = count % 5
| cofilter user item

```


The results look something like this:


| Item 1 | Item 1 user count | Item 2 | Item 2 user count | Pair count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
