# addinfo


## Description

Adds fields to each event that contain global, common information about the search. This command is primarily an internally-used component of Summary Indexing.


## Syntax

addinfo

The following fields are added to each event when you use the addinfo command.


| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| info_min_time | The earliest time boundary for the search. |
| info_max_time | The latest time boundary for the search. |
| info_sid | The ID of the search that generated the event. |
| info_search_time | The time when the search was run. |



## Usage

The addinfo command is a distributable streaming command. See Command types .


## Examples


### 1. Add information to each event

Add information about the search to each event.

CODE

Copy

... | addinfo


```spl

... | addinfo

```



### 2. Determine which heartbeats are later than expected

You can use this example to track heartbeats from hosts, forwarders, tcpin_connections on indexers, or any number of system components. This example uses hosts.

You have a list of host names in a lookup file called expected_hosts . You want to search for heartbeats from your hosts that are after an expected time range. You use the addinfo command to add information to each event that will help you evaluate the time range.

CODE

Copy

... | stats latest(_time) AS latest_time BY host
| addinfo | eval latest_age = info_max_time - latest_time | fields - info_\*
| inputlookup append=t expected_hosts | fillnull value=9999 latest_age
| dedup host
| where latest_age &gt; 42


```spl

... | stats latest(_time) AS latest_time BY host
| addinfo | eval latest_age = info_max_time - latest_time | fields - info_*
| inputlookup append=t expected_hosts | fillnull value=9999 latest_age
| dedup host
| where latest_age > 42

```


Use the stats command to calculate the latest heartbeat by host. The addinfo command adds information to each result. This search uses info_max_time , which is the latest time boundary for the search. The eval command is used to create a field called latest_age and calculate the age of the heartbeats relative to end of the time range. This allows for a time range of -11m@m to -m@m . This is the previous 11 minutes, starting at the beginning of the minute, to the previous 1 minute, starting at the beginning of the minute. The search does not work if you specify latest=null / all time because info_max_time would be set to +infinity.

Using the lookup file, expected_hosts , append the list of hosts to the results. Using this list you can determine which hosts are not sending a heartbeat in the expected time range. For any hosts that have a null value in the latest_age field, fill the field with the value 9999. Remove any duplicated host events with the dedup command. Use the where command to filter the results and return any heartbeats older than 42 seconds.


> **Note: In this example, you could use the tstats command, instead of the stats command, to improve the performance of the search.**
