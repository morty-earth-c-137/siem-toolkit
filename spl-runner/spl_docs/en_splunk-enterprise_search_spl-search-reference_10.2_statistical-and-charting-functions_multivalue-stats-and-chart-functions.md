# Multivalue stats and chart functions


## list(&lt;value&gt;)


### Description

The list function returns a multivalue entry from the values in a field. The order of the values reflects the order of the events.


### Usage

You can use this function with the chart , stats , and timechart commands.

- If more than 100 values are in a field, only the first 100 are returned.

- This function processes field values as strings.


### Basic example

To illustrate what the list function does, let's start by generating a few simple results.

- Use the makeresults and streamstats commands to generate a set of results that are simply timestamps and a count of the results which are used as row numbers. CODE Copy | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: _time rowNumber 2018-04-02 20:27:11 1 2018-04-02 20:27:11 2 2018-04-02 20:27:11 3 2018-04-02 20:27:11 4 2018-04-02 20:27:11 5 Notice that each result appears on a separate row.

- Add the stats command with the list function to the search. The numbers are returned in ascending order in a single, multivalue result. CODE Copy | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber | stats list(rowNumber) AS numbers | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber | stats list(rowNumber) AS numbers The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: numbers 1 2 3 4 5 Notice that it is a single result. There are no alternating row background colors.

- Compare this result with the results returned by the values function.


## values(&lt;values&gt;)


### Description

The values function returns a list of the distinct values in a field as a multivalue entry. The order of the values is lexicographical.


### Usage

You can use the values(X) function with the chart , stats , timechart , and tstats commands.

- By default there is no limit to the number of values returned. Users with the appropriate permissions can specify a limit in the limits.conf file. You specify the limit in the [stats | sistats] stanza using the maxvalues setting.

- This function processes field values as strings.


### Lexicographical order

Lexicographical order sorts items based on the values used to encode the items in computer memory. In Splunk software, this is almost always UTF-8 encoding, which is a superset of ASCII.

- Numbers are sorted before letters. Numbers are sorted based on the first digit. For example, the numbers 10, 9, 70, 100 are sorted lexicographically as 10, 100, 70, 9.

- Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters.

- Symbols are not standard. Some symbols are sorted before numeric values. Other symbols are sorted before or after letters.


### Basic example

To illustrate what the values function does, let's start by generating a few simple results.

- Use the makeresults and streamstats commands to generate a set of results that are simply timestamps and a count of the results, which are used as row numbers. CODE Copy | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: _time rowNumber 2018-04-02 20:27:11 1 2018-04-02 20:27:11 2 2018-04-02 20:27:11 3 2018-04-02 20:27:11 4 2018-04-02 20:27:11 5 Notice that each result appears on a separate row.

- Add the stats command with the values function to the search. The results are returned in lexicographical order. CODE Copy | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber | stats values(rowNumber) AS numbers | makeresults count=1000 | streamstats count AS rowNumber | stats values(rowNumber) AS numbers The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: numbers 1 10 100 1000 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 11 110 Notice that it is a single result. There are no alternating row background colors.

- Compare these results with the results returned by the list function.
