# typer


## Description

Creates an eventtype field for search results that match known event types. You must create event types to use this command. See About event types in the Knowledge Manager Manual .


## Syntax

The required syntax is in bold .

typer

[eventtypes=&lt;string&gt;]

[maxlen=&lt;unsigned_integer&gt;]


### Required arguments

None.


### Optional arguments

eventtypes

Syntax: eventtypes=&lt;string&gt;

Description: Provide a comma-separated list of event types to filter the set of event types that typer can return in the eventtype field. The eventtypes argument filters out all event types except the valid event types in its list. If all of the event types listed for eventtypes are invalid, or if no event types are listed, typer is turned off and will not return any event types. The eventtypes argument accepts wildcards.

Default: No default (by default typer returns all available event types)

maxlen

Syntax: maxlen=&lt;unsigned_integer&gt;

Description: By default, the typer command looks at the first 10000 characters of an event to determine its event type. Use maxlen to override this default. For example, maxlen=300 restricts typer to determining event types from the first 300 characters of events.


## Usage
