# typelearner




> **CAUTION: The typelearner command is deprecated as of Splunk Enterprise version 5.0. This means that although the command continues to function, it might be removed in a future version. Use the findtypes command instead.**



## Description

Generates suggested event types by taking previous search results and producing a list of potential searches that can be used as event types. By default, the typelearner command initially groups events by the value of the grouping-field. The search then unifies and merges these groups based on the keywords they contain.


## Syntax

typelearner [&lt;grouping-field&gt;] [&lt;grouping-maxlen&gt;]


### Optional arguments

grouping-field

Syntax: &lt;field&gt;

Description: The field with values for the typelearner comman to use when initially grouping events.

Default: punct , the punctuation seen in _raw

grouping-maxlen

Syntax: maxlen=&lt;int&gt;

Description: Determines how many characters in the grouping-field value to look at. If set to negative, the entire value of the grouping-field value is used to group events.

Default: 15


## Examples


### Example 1:

Have the search automatically discover and apply event types to search results.
