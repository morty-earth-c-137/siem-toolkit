# addtotals


## Description

The addtotals command computes the arithmetic sum of all numeric fields for each search result. The results appear in the Statistics tab.

You can specify a list of fields that you want the sum for, instead of calculating every numeric field. The sum is placed in a new field.

If col=true , the addtotals command computes the column totals, which adds a new result at the end that represents the sum of each field. labelfield , if specified, is a field that will be added to this summary event with the value set by the 'label' option. Alternately, instead of using the addtotals col=true command, you can use the addcoltotals command to calculate a summary event.


## Syntax

addtotals [row=&lt;bool&gt;] [col=&lt;bool&gt;] [labelfield=&lt;field&gt;] [label=&lt;string&gt;] [fieldname=&lt;field&gt;] [&lt;field-list&gt;]


### Required arguments

None.


### Optional arguments

field-list

Syntax: &lt;field&gt; ...

Description: One or more numeric fields, delimited with a space. Only the fields specified in the &lt;field-list&gt; are summed. If a &lt;field-list&gt; is not specified, all numeric fields are included in the sum.

Usage: You can use wildcards in the field names. For example, if the field names are count1 , count2 , and count3 you can specify count\* to indicate all fields that begin with 'count'.

Default: All numeric fields are included in the sum.

row

Syntax: row=&lt;bool&gt;

Description: Specifies whether to calculate the sum of the &lt;field-list&gt; for each event. This is similar to calculating a total for each row in a table. The sum is placed in a new field. The default name of the field is Total . If you want to specify a different name for the field, use the fieldname argument.

Usage: Because the default is row=true , specify the row argument only when you do not want the event totals to appear row=false .

Default: true

col

Syntax: col=&lt;bool&gt;

Description: Specifies whether to add a new event, referred to as a summary event, at the bottom of the list of events. The summary event displays the sum of each field in the events, similar to calculating column totals in a table.

Default: false

fieldname

Syntax: fieldname=&lt;field&gt;

Description: Used to specify the name of the field that contains the calculated sum of the field-list for each event. The fieldname argument is valid only when row=true .

Default: Total

labelfield

Syntax: labelfield=&lt;field&gt;

Description: Used to specify a field for the summary event label. The labelfield argument is valid only when col=true .

To use an existing field in your result set, specify the field name for the labelfield argument. For example if the field name is IP , specify labelfield=IP .

If there is no field in your result set that matches the labelfield , a new field is added using the labelfield value.

Default: none

label

Syntax: label=&lt;string&gt;

Description: Used to specify a row label for the summary event.

If the labelfield argument is an existing field in your result set, the label value appears in that row in the display.

If the labelfield argument creates a new field, the label appears in the new field in the summary event row.

Default: Total


## Usage

The addtotals command is a distributable streaming command, except when is used to calculate column totals. When used to calculate column totals, the addtotals command is a transforming command. See Command types .


## Examples


### 1: Calculate the sum of the numeric fields of each event

This example uses events that list the numeric sales for each product and quarter, for example:


| products | quarter | sales | quota |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProductA | QTR1 | 1200 | 1000 |
| ProductB | QTR1 | 1400 | 1550 |
| ProductC | QTR1 | 1650 | 1275 |
| ProductA | QTR2 | 1425 | 1300 |
| ProductB | QTR2 | 1175 | 1425 |
| ProductC | QTR2 | 1550 | 1450 |
| ProductA | QTR3 | 1300 | 1400 |
| ProductB | QTR3 | 1250 | 1125 |
| ProductC | QTR3 | 1375 | 1475 |
| ProductA | QTR4 | 1550 | 1300 |
| ProductB | QTR4 | 1700 | 1225 |
| ProductC | QTR4 | 1625 | 1350 |


Use the chart command to summarize data

To summarize the data by product for each quarter, run this search:



CODE

Copy

source="addtotalsData.csv" | chart sum(sales) BY products quarter


```spl

source="addtotalsData.csv" | chart sum(sales) BY products quarter

```


In this example, there are two fields specified in the BY clause with the chart command.

- The products field is referred to as the &lt;row-split&gt; field.

- The quarter field is referred to as the &lt;column-split&gt; field.

The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this:


| products | QTR1 | QTR2 | QTR3 | QTR4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProductA | 1200 | 1425 | 1300 | 1550 |
| ProductB | 1400 | 1175 | 1250 | 1700 |
| ProductC | 1650 | 1550 | 1375 | 1625 |




To add a column that generates totals for each row, run this search:



CODE

Copy

source="addtotalsData.csv" | chart sum(sales) BY products quarter | addtotals


```spl

source="addtotalsData.csv" | chart sum(sales) BY products quarter | addtotals

```


The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this:


| products | QTR1 | QTR2 | QTR3 | QTR4 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProductA | 1200 | 1425 | 1300 | 1550 | 5475 |
| ProductB | 1400 | 1175 | 1250 | 1700 | 5525 |
| ProductC | 1650 | 1550 | 1375 | 1625 | 6200 |


Use the stats command to calculate totals

If all you need are the totals for each product, a simpler solution is to use the


```spl

stats

```


command:



CODE

Copy

source="addtotalsData.csv" | stats sum(sales) BY products


```spl

source="addtotalsData.csv" | stats sum(sales) BY products

```


The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this:


| products | sum(sales) |
| --- | --- |
| ProductA | 5475 |
| ProductB | 5525 |
| ProductC | 6200 |



### 2. Specify a name for the field that contains the sums for each event

Instead of accepting the default name added by the addtotals command, you can specify a name for the field.

CODE

Copy

... | addtotals fieldname=sum


```spl

... | addtotals fieldname=sum

```



### 3. Use wildcards to specify the names of the fields to sum

Calculate the sums for the fields that begin with amount or that contain the text size in the field name. Save the sums in the field called TotalAmount .

CODE

Copy

... | addtotals fieldname=TotalAmount amount\* \*size\*


```spl

... | addtotals fieldname=TotalAmount amount* *size*

```



### 4. Calculate the sum for a specific field

In this example, the row calculations are turned off and the column calculations are turned on. The total for only a single field, sum(quota) , is calculated.

CODE

Copy

source="addtotalsData.csv" | stats sum(quota) by quarter| addtotals row=f col=t labelfield=quarter sum(quota)


```spl

source="addtotalsData.csv" | stats sum(quota) by quarter| addtotals row=f col=t labelfield=quarter sum(quota)

```


- The labelfield argument specifies in which field the label for the total appears. The default label is Total .

The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this:


| quarter | sum(quota) |
| --- | --- |
| QTR1 | 3825 |
| QTR2 | 4175 |
| QTR3 | 4000 |
| QTR4 | 3875 |
| Total | 15875 |



### 5. Calculate the field totals and add custom labels to the totals

Calculate the sum for each quarter and product, and calculate a grand total.

CODE

Copy

source="addtotalsData.csv" | chart sum(sales) by products quarter| addtotals col=t labelfield=products label="Quarterly Totals" fieldname="Product Totals"


```spl

source="addtotalsData.csv" | chart sum(sales) by products quarter| addtotals col=t labelfield=products label="Quarterly Totals" fieldname="Product Totals"

```


- The labelfield argument specifies in which field the label for the total appears, which in this example is products .

- The label argument is used to specify the label Quarterly Totals for the labelfield , instead of using the default label Total .

- The fieldname argument is used to specify the label Product Totals for the row totals.

The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this:


| products | QTR1 | QTR2 | QTR3 | QTR4 | Product Totals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProductA | 1200 | 1425 | 1300 | 1550 | 5475 |
| ProductB | 1400 | 1175 | 1250 | 1700 | 5525 |
| ProductC | 1650 | 1550 | 1375 | 1625 | 6200 |
| Quarterly Totals | 4250 | 4150 | 3925 | 4875 | 17200 |
